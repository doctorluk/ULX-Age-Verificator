## What it is for
This plugin can be installed on Garry's Mod servers to help you keep minors from your server

## What it does
It shows new players a form in which they have to enter their Date of Birth and the matching Zodiac Sign. If they are below your configured age, they are being banned approx. until they turn that age.
In case of an invalid date (e.g. 30th February) or inconsistent entries (any following entry doesn't match the previous) the player is banned, too.

By default this plugin suggests using Source-Bans for ULX.

## Requirements
This addon was made to be used with ULX which can be found here: http://ulyssesmod.net/
